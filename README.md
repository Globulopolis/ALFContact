# ALFContact

**This version is only for Joomla 5+**

The purpose of ALFContact is to provide a contactform with enough features to make it usefull and appealing whithout making it overly complicated.
Basically the form gives you the option to send messages to different aliases based on your accesslevel, these aliases are defined in the administrator section, each with their own set of options.

E.g. create aliasses for Sales or Billing or Webmaster, add a prefix, custom optional field, default subject and/or redirect as you like and you're set.
If the user isn't logged in it will show inputboxes for adding reply info, once they're logged in, it will automatically show their data.
